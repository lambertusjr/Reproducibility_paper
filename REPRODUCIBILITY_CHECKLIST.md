# Reproducibility Checklist

This checklist is adapted from common reproducibility guidelines (NeurIPS, ACM, etc.) and should be completed as part of the reproducibility study.

## Code and Data Availability

- [ ] Original paper's code is publicly available
- [ ] Original paper's data is publicly available
- [ ] Original paper's code runs without errors
- [ ] Original paper's data is in usable format
- [ ] Pre-trained models are available (if applicable)
- [ ] Random seeds are documented
- [ ] Code dependencies are documented

## Documentation Quality

- [ ] README with clear instructions exists
- [ ] Installation instructions are complete
- [ ] Dependencies are specified with versions
- [ ] Hardware requirements are documented
- [ ] Expected runtime is documented
- [ ] Examples or demos are provided
- [ ] License information is clear

## Experimental Setup

- [ ] Hyperparameters are fully specified
- [ ] Data preprocessing steps are documented
- [ ] Train/validation/test splits are specified
- [ ] Evaluation metrics are clearly defined
- [ ] Statistical significance tests are described
- [ ] Multiple runs with error bars are reported

## Results

- [ ] Main results are reproduced within acceptable margin
- [ ] Computational requirements match documentation
- [ ] Runtime matches expectations
- [ ] Results are consistent across multiple runs
- [ ] Edge cases behave as expected

## Deviations

- [ ] All deviations from original are documented
- [ ] Reasons for deviations are provided
- [ ] Impact of deviations is analyzed

## Reproducibility Score

Rate each category on a scale of 0-5:
- 0: Not reproducible
- 1: Partially reproducible with major issues
- 2: Reproducible with significant effort
- 3: Reproducible with moderate effort
- 4: Easily reproducible with minor issues
- 5: Fully reproducible
