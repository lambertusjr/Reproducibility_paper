# Reproducibility Paper Structure Guide

This document explains the structure and purpose of each section in a reproducibility paper.

## Core Components

### 1. Abstract
- Brief summary of the reproducibility study
- Should include: original paper, reproduction goals, key findings
- Typically 150-250 words

### 2. Introduction
- Context and motivation for the study
- Importance of reproducibility in research
- Specific objectives and scope of reproduction
- Structure of the remainder of the paper

### 3. Original Paper Summary
- Objective overview of the paper being reproduced
- Key claims and contributions
- Methodology and results
- Help readers understand the original work without reading it

### 4. Reproducibility Methodology
- Your approach to reproduction
- Resources and timeline
- Any necessary deviations and their justifications
- Transparency about the reproduction process

### 5. Experimental Setup
- Detailed technical specifications
- Hardware and software environment
- Datasets and preprocessing
- Implementation details and configurations
- Should enable others to reproduce your reproduction

### 6. Results
- Your reproduced results with evidence (tables, figures, metrics)
- Direct comparison with original paper's results
- Statistical analysis of differences
- Analysis of variation across multiple runs

### 7. Reproducibility Assessment
- Clear statement of what was/wasn't reproduced
- Reproducibility score (if using formal framework)
- Challenges and obstacles encountered
- Honest assessment of reproducibility quality

### 8. Discussion
- Interpretation of findings
- Impact of any deviations
- Quality assessment of original work
- Lessons learned from the process

### 9. Recommendations
- Suggestions for original authors
- Advice for future reproducibility studies
- Broader implications for research community

### 10. Conclusion
- Summary of key findings
- Final reproducibility assessment
- Contribution to reproducibility literature

## Supporting Materials

### Appendices
- Detailed results tables
- Code repository information
- Computational requirements breakdown
- Reproducibility checklist

### Supplementary Files
- Complete code with documentation
- Data or data access instructions
- Configuration files
- Additional figures and tables

## Best Practices

### Objectivity
- Report both successes and failures honestly
- Avoid blaming or criticizing original authors
- Focus on constructive feedback

### Transparency
- Document all decisions and deviations
- Provide complete technical details
- Share all code and data (when possible)

### Rigor
- Run multiple experiments with different seeds
- Perform statistical tests
- Validate results thoroughly

### Clarity
- Use clear, precise language
- Provide tables and figures for comparison
- Structure information logically

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Insufficient detail**: Provide enough information for others to reproduce your reproduction
2. **Unfair comparison**: Ensure comparison conditions are appropriate
3. **Lack of statistical rigor**: Use proper statistical methods
4. **Missing context**: Explain why differences might occur
5. **Incomplete testing**: Test all major claims, not just convenient ones

## Citation Guidelines

- Cite the original paper prominently
- Cite related reproducibility studies
- Cite any tools, frameworks, or datasets used
- Cite reproducibility guidelines followed

## Submission Considerations

Different venues have different requirements:
- **Workshops**: May accept shorter reports
- **Conferences**: Often have dedicated reproducibility tracks
- **Journals**: May require extensive detail
- **Platforms**: ReScience, Papers with Code, etc.

Check specific venue guidelines before submission.
