# Reproducibility Paper

A comprehensive structure for writing reproducibility studies in academic research.

## Overview

This repository provides a complete template structure for writing reproducibility papers. The structure follows best practices from major conferences and journals (NeurIPS, ACM, ReScience, etc.) and includes all necessary sections for a thorough reproducibility study.

## Repository Contents

- **paper.md** - Main paper template with all standard sections
- **STRUCTURE.md** - Detailed guide explaining each section's purpose
- **REPRODUCIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md** - Comprehensive checklist for reproducibility assessment

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a Paper**: Select the original paper you want to reproduce
2. **Read the Structure Guide**: Review `STRUCTURE.md` to understand each section
3. **Fill in paper.md**: Work through each section systematically
4. **Complete the Checklist**: Use `REPRODUCIBILITY_CHECKLIST.md` to track progress
5. **Document Everything**: Be thorough and transparent in your documentation

## Paper Sections

The main paper template includes:

1. **Abstract** - Study summary
2. **Introduction** - Context and motivation
3. **Original Paper Summary** - Overview of work being reproduced
4. **Reproducibility Methodology** - Your approach
5. **Experimental Setup** - Technical details
6. **Results** - Your findings
7. **Reproducibility Assessment** - Success/failure analysis
8. **Discussion** - Interpretation and insights
9. **Recommendations** - Suggestions for improvement
10. **Conclusion** - Summary and final assessment
11. **References** - Bibliography
12. **Appendices** - Supporting materials

## Best Practices

- **Be Objective**: Report successes and failures honestly
- **Be Transparent**: Document all decisions and deviations
- **Be Rigorous**: Use proper statistical methods and multiple runs
- **Be Clear**: Provide enough detail for others to reproduce your work

## Recommended Workflow

1. Set up your reproduction environment
2. Document the original paper's claims (Section 2)
3. Attempt reproduction and document process (Sections 3-4)
4. Record results and compare (Section 5)
5. Analyze reproducibility (Section 6)
6. Discuss findings (Sections 7-8)
7. Complete reproducibility checklist
8. Write conclusion (Section 9)
9. Review and refine entire paper
